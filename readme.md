## ðŸŽ§ Moscow and St. Petersburg Music Preferences Project

### Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze and compare the music preferences of users in Moscow and St. Petersburg. The project aims to debunk myths surrounding these cities, such as Moscow being a bustling metropolis driven by a strict workweek, while St. Petersburg is known for its unique culture, distinct from Moscow. By analyzing user activity and music preferences, the project seeks to determine the validity of these stereotypes, helping businesses make rational decisions based on data.

### Hypotheses
The project tests the following hypotheses:

1. **User activity depends on the day of the week, and this pattern differs between Moscow and St. Petersburg.**
2. **On Monday mornings, different music genres dominate in Moscow and St. Petersburg, and the same is true for Friday evenings.**
3. **Moscow and St. Petersburg have different genre preferences, with pop music being more popular in Moscow and Russian rap in St. Petersburg.**
